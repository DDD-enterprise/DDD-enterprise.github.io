 
This site is dedicated to documenting and refining the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) process in an enterprise context, bridging the gap between business strategy and technical implementation.

Start at the core: Define and structure high-level business processes.
    
Map essential interactions: Capture the necessary application workflows for each business step.
    
Deliver real-world solutions: Provide source code for critical components to accelerate development.
    
Evolve with purpose: Grow towards a source-available, EU-compliant social network application—built for the future of enterprise software.

The intention is to become more than documentation. It’s a blueprint for building robust, scalable, and legally compliant enterprise applications with Domain-Driven Design at the helm.
