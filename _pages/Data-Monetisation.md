Data monetisation

Data monetization under **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** is legal **only if** it complies with the regulationâ€™s strict requirements. GDPR does not outright ban data monetization, but it **restricts** how personal data can be processed, shared, and sold.  

### **Key GDPR Requirements for Legal Data Monetization**  

1. **User Consent (Article 6 & 7)**  
   - Businesses **must** obtain clear, informed, and freely given **consent** before monetizing personal data.  
   - Pre-checked boxes or vague terms do **not** count as valid consent.  
   - Users must be able to withdraw consent at any time.  

2. **Legitimate Interest (Article 6.1(f))**  
   - Companies can process data **without consent** if they can prove a "legitimate interest" that does not override user rights.  
   - However, data selling or extensive profiling usually **requires** explicit consent.  

3. **Data Minimization & Purpose Limitation (Articles 5 & 25)**  
   - Companies **cannot** collect more data than needed for a specific, **clearly stated** purpose.  
   - Data collected for one reason **cannot** be reused for unrelated monetization purposes.  

4. **Right to Access, Erasure, and Portability (Articles 15-20)**  
   - Users have the **right to request** a copy of their data, delete it, or move it to another service.  
   - Companies must **comply within 30 days** of the request.  

5. **No Selling to Third Parties Without User Control**  
   - GDPR heavily regulates selling personal data to advertisers, data brokers, or third parties.  
   - If data is **anonymized** (so individuals cannot be identified), it **may** be monetized without direct consent.  

### **Is It Legal?**  
âœ… **Legal** if:  
   - Users give **explicit, informed consent** for data monetization.  
   - Data is **anonymized** before being sold/shared.  
   - Processing is necessary for **legitimate business purposes** and does not violate user rights.  

ðŸš« **Illegal** if:  
   - Data is collected **without** clear user consent.  
   - Users **cannot** opt out of data sharing.  
   - Data is sold to **third parties** without transparency.  
   - Data is misused beyond its original **declared purpose**.
