### **Viral Distribution by Social Network**  
Viral distribution" refers to how a platform's users naturally spread content, attracting new users without direct marketing efforts. Below is a breakdown of how each social network enables viral distribution:  

Peter Thiel made the following quote about viral behaviour of software:
“A product is viral if its core functionality encourages users to invite their friends to become users too. This is how Facebook and PayPal both grew quickly: every time someone shares with a friend or makes a payment, they naturally invite more and more people into the network. This isn’t just cheap—it’s fast, too.” 

| Social Network | Viral Distribution Mechanism |
|---------------|-----------------------------|

| **Twitter (X)** | Retweets, quote tweets, trending hashtags, and virality-driven engagement amplify reach. |
| **Google** | YouTube (a Google product) leverages recommendation algorithms; Google Search prioritizes popular content. |
| **Telegram** | Public channels, group shares, and forwarded messages allow rapid content spread among users. |
| **WhatsApp** | End-to-end encrypted message forwarding in group chats enables viral content sharing. |
| **Instagram** | Reels, stories, and Explore page amplify trending content; influencer reposts drive visibility. |
